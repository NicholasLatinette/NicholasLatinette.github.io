Website made to showcase some of my skills and also give some information about me. This is effectively meant to be a personal website coded by me.

I have some plans for the future of the website but for now I want it to be a simple, nice looking website made and designed by me.

Some Plans:
Blog (of course)
Accessiblity option to get rid of fancy visuals and JS and just have a super simple static black and white website.
Styling fixing and making lowering bloat of overall classes written
